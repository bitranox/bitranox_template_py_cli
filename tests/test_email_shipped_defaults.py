"""The template's shipped [email] defaults keep the library's attachment protection on.

The shipped file writes [] for the four attachment lists, meaning "the library's defaults".
For ConfMail an empty allowed list allows nothing and an empty blocked list blocks nothing,
so the translation must drop them: a dangerous attachment is refused and an ordinary one
delivered, both with the shipped file read as it ships.
